# Project Name

We created a chatbot for corona testing and vaccin booking. For this project we worked with javascript with functions and conditionals. 

## The problem

When we were creating the chat we had problems with changing the questions and making the user's answer show in the chat. We understood that we could send one question to the next with addEventListener with click and setTimeout so it moves smoothly, to get the human feeling for the user. The problem with the user's answer we solved by asking about it in StackOverflow and understood that we forgot to also add showMessenger(‘input’, ‘user’). When we did that our problem got solved.
